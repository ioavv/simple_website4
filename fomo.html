      <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.
        CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.
        CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.
        External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.

      <p>The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language 
        for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.
        It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
        and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

        Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage
        and render the documents into multimedia web pages.
        HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally
        included cues for its appearance.
        HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs,
        images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the 
        rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting
        structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes,
        and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.
        Tags such as and  directly introduce content into the page.
        Other tags such as and surround and provide information about document text and may
        include sub-element tags. Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the
         content of the page.
